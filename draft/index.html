                        <p>This Non-disclosure Agreement (this "Agreement") is made effective as of November 25, 2020
                            (the "Effective Date"), by and between
                            <span class="a"></span> (the "Owner"), of <br><br><span class="a"></span>

                            The Owner has requested and the Recipient agrees that the Recipient will protect the
                            confidential material and information which may be disclosed between the Owner and the
                            Recipient. Therefore, the parties agree as follows:<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p><br><br> <strong>I. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. </strong>The term "Confidential Information"
                            means any information or material which is proprietary to the Owner, whether or not owned or
                            developed by the Owner, which is not generally known other than by the Owner, and which the
                            Recipient may obtain through any direct or indirect contact with the Owner. Regardless of
                            whether specifically identified as confidential or proprietary, Confidential Information
                            shall include any information provided by the Owner concerning the business, technology and
                            information of the Owner and any third party with which the Owner deals, including, without
                            limitation, business records and plans, trade secrets, technical data, product ideas,
                            contracts, financial information, pricing structure, discounts, computer programs and
                            listings, source code and/or object code, copyrights and intellectual property, inventions,
                            sales leads, strategic alliances, partners, and customer and client lists. The nature of the
                            information and the manner of disclosure are such that a reasonable person would understand
                            it to be confidential.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> <strong> A. "Confidential Information"</strong> does not
                            include:<br><br>

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-matters of public knowledge that result from disclosure
                            by the Owner;<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- information rightfully received by the Recipient from a
                            third party without a duty of confidentiality;<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- information independently developed by the
                            Recipient;<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- information disclosed by operation of law;<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- information disclosed by the Recipient with the prior
                            written consent of the Owner;<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and any other information that both parties agree in
                            writing is not confidential.

                            <br><br> <strong>II. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. </strong>The Recipient
                            understands and acknowledges that the Confidential Information has been developed or
                            obtained by the Owner by the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that
                            the Confidential Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Owner which
                            provides the Owner with a significant competitive advantage, and needs to be protected from
                            improper disclosure. In consideration for the receipt by the Recipient of the Confidential
                            Information, the Recipient agrees as follows:

                            <br><br> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. No Disclosure.</strong> The Recipient
                            will hold the Confidential Information in confidence and will not disclose the Confidential
                            Information to any person or entity without the prior written consent of the Owner.

                            <br><br> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. No Copying/Modifying. </strong>The
                            Recipient will not copy or modify any Confidential Information without the prior written
                            consent
                            of the Owner.

                            <br><br> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C. Unauthorized Use.</strong> The
                            Recipient shall promptly advise the Owner if the Recipient becomes aware of any possible
                            unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.

                            <br><br> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D. Application to Employees.</strong>
                            The Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any employees of the
                            Recipient,
                            except those employees who are required to have the Confidential Information in order to
                            perform their job duties in connection
                            with the limited purposes of this Agreement. Each permitted employee to whom Confidential
                            Information is disclosed shall sign
                            a non-disclosure agreement substantially the same as this Agreement at the request of the
                            Owner.

                            <br><br> <strong>III. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION - INJUNCTION.</strong> If it
                            appears that the Recipient has disclosed (or has threatened to disclose) Confidential
                            Information in violation of this Agreement, the Owner shall be entitled to an injunction to
                            restrain the Recipient from disclosing the Confidential Information in whole or in part. The
                            Owner shall not be prohibited by this provision from pursuing other remedies, including a
                            claim for losses and damages.

                            <br><br> <strong>IV. NON-CIRCUMVENTION. </strong>For a period of five (5) years after the
                            end of the term of this Agreement, the Recipient will not attempt to do business with, or
                            otherwise solicit any business contacts found or otherwise referred by Owner to Recipient
                            for the purpose of circumventing, the result of which shall be to prevent the Owner from
                            realizing or recognizing a profit, fees, or otherwise, without the specific written approval
                            of the Owner. If such circumvention shall occur the Owner shall be entitled to any
                            commissions due pursuant to this Agreement or relating to such transaction.

                            <br><br> <strong>V. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong> Upon the written request of
                            the Owner, the Recipient shall return to the Owner all written materials containing the

                            related materials during the period of this Agreement.

                            harmless the other party and its officers, directors, agents, affiliates, distributors,

                            Agreement.

                            <br><br> <strong>X. ATTORNEY'S FEES.</strong> In any legal action between the parties
                            concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable

                            <br><br> <strong>XI. TERM. </strong>The obligations of this Agreement shall survive <span
                                class="a"></span> from the Effective Date or until the Owner sends the Recipient written
                            notice releasing the Recipient from this Agreement. After that, the Recipient must continue
                            to protect the Confidential Information that was received during the term of this Agreement
                            from unauthorized use or disclosure indefinitely.

                            effect at all times in accordance with the term of this Agreement. If any provision of this
                            Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this
                            Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and construed so as to best effectuate the
                            original intent and purpose of this Agreement.

                            <br><br> <strong>XIII. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION.</strong> This Agreement is in compliance
                            with the Defend Trade Secrets Act and provides civil or criminal immunity to any individual

                            <br><br> <strong>XIV. SIGNATORIES.</strong> This Agreement shall be executed by <span
                                class="a"></span> , on behalf of <span class="a"></span> and <span class="a"></span> and
